# Extra_Credit
This is the Extra Credit that I did in my CIS 440 Unix Course, was fun to make and learned alot about scripting. Enjoy. 

### Different functions
Their are different fuctions that are all stored in the funtion directory which is each called in the main.sh file. Each script has their own designated job suc as creating, deleting , updating, reading and grouping a csv file.

### Just the potential of Bash
Aiming to use popular Linux distros as my daliy drives and rely less on Windows for the forseable future.
